## Title: House Price Prediction

## Overview 

This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website.The first step includes downloading the bengaluru dataset from kaggle,then loading the data into a notebook, cleaning, visualizing, removal of outliers, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation then building a model using sklearn and linear regression. 
Then write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Then build a website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. 

## Technology and tools used;

- Python 
- Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
- Matplotlib for data visualization 
- Sklearn for model building
- Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
- Python flask for http server
- HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
